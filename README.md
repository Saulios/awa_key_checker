# AWA Key Checker
Script that you can paste in your browser console to tell you the current amount of keys, level requirements and restrictions for Alienware giveaways.
Give it a look to see some information on offers, and to see if keys are available in your region.

Paste the total contents of the `awa_key_checker.js` file into your browser console (F12 or Ctrl + Shift + J)
when you are on an Alienware Arena giveaway page.
